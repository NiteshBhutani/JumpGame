-- Add character and animation of jumping instead of box - done
-- Add score entity on top right corner
-- End game when box is down certain position - done
-- Fix how much box can travel in x-direction when on platform - done
-- Once jumped box cannot return to same platform - fix this behavior -done - The reason this is happening is because as time increase  position between each time step is greater than
																		height(10 units) becuase of acceleration. Correct solution will be if displacement is greater than 10 uints then
																		linear interpolation to see if botton part of character passes the platform
-- Fix all the dimension and put it constants.hpp
-- look into gracity constant and speed rate and inital velocity --- think how many pixel should player move per fram and be consistent
